TimSort

TimSort is a sorting algorithm based on Insertion Sort and Merge Sort.

A stable sorting algorithm works in O(n Log n) time

Used in Java’s Arrays.sort() as well as Python’s sorted() and sort().

First sort small pieces using Insertion Sort, then merges the pieces using merge of merge sort.

We divides the Arrays into blocks known as Run. 
We sort those runs using insertion sort one by one and then merge those runs using combine function used in merge sort.
If size of Array is less than run, then Array get sorted just by using Insertion Sort.
The size of run may vary from 32 to 64 depending upon size of array.
The merge function performs well when sizes subarrays are powers of 2.
The idea is based on the fact that insertion sort performs well for small arrays.
